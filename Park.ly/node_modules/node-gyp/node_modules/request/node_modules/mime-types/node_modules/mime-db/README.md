This is a database of all mime types.
It consists of a single, public JSON file and does not include any logic,
allowing it to remain as un-opinionated as possible with an API.
It aggregates data from the following sources:

- http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml
- http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/httpd/trunk/docs/conf/mime.types
- http://hg.nginx.org/nginx/raw-file/default/conf/mime.types

## Installation

```bash
npm install mime-db
```

### Database Download

If you're crazy enough to use this in the browser, you can just grab the
JSON file using [RawGit](https://rawgit.com/). It is recommended to replace
`master` with [a release tag](https://github.com/jshttp/mime-db/tags) as the
JSON format may change in the future.
